# Compiler Design
Compiler's final project for the Spring 2020 Compiler Design course in Amirkabir University of Technology.
This project contains phase 1 and phase 2. In phase 1, we build a Lexical Analyzer, and in phase 2, we design a Bottom-Up LALR parser. The complete description of the phases can be found in `Prj1-lexer` and `Prj2-LALR`.
